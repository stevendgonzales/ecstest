Tips on writing test cases

* keep test case short with expected run time to be < 1min for each test case.
* when each file contains more than 20 test cases, consider to refactor and split
* any error will be raised as exception. no need to have overly complex exception catch and handling code
* learn from examples
* each test case function shall have a JIRA ID associated with it
* use comments wisely. Not to explain what to do since code already did. Comment is to explain a complex data structure, an algorithm, or why choose this implementation vs. another.
